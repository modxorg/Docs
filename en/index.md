MODX Revolution (Revo) is an easy-to-use Content Management System (CMS) and Application Framework rolled into one. Despite the limitless possibilities that MODX affords you, we think you'll find it refreshingly intuitive to work with. At every step, MODX strives to deliver Creative Freedom.

With MODX3, the platform has been modernised, and also offers a redesigned manager user interface. [Learn more about upgrading to MODX 3](getting-started/maintenance/upgrading/3.0).

## What about MODX Evolution?

Evolution is MODX's classic codebase - the original version released in 2005. [As of April 2017](https://modx.com/blog/evolution-cms-has-a-new-home) Evolution is officially a separate project, no longer under the wings of MODX. That means Evolution has its own leadership, processes, and community.

All information about Evolution, including documentation and extras, can be found at [evo.im](https://evo.im/).
