## What about MODX Evolution?

Evolution is MODX's classic codebase - the original version released in 2005. [As of April 2017](https://modx.com/blog/evolution-cms-has-a-new-home) Evolution is officially a separate project, no longer under the wings of MODX. That means Evolution has its own leadership, processes, and community.

All information about Evolution, including documentation and extras, can be found at [evo.im](https://evo.im/).
