title: Server Requirements
---

The minimum PHP version supported for MODX 3.0 is **PHP 7.1** (previously this was PHP 5.3). It is expected that the minimum requirements will more closely follow the [official PHP support dates](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) in the future.

The requirements for type of webserver or database versions has not changed. [Find all server requirements for MODX here](getting-started/server-requirements).
