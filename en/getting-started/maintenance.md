## Maintenance

After MODX is installed, there maybe some needs to maintain your site.

This could be one of the following:

1. [Securing / hardening your MODX Site](getting-started/maintenance/securing-modx.md)
2. [Moving a MODX from one server to another](getting-started/maintenance/moving-your-site.md)
3. [Upgrading a MODX installation](getting-started/maintenance/upgrading.md)
