Display a list of downloadable files without revealing the file url.

This MODX Extra can be used to display a list of files from a directory. The download link for each file is hashed. 
This way, the full url of the file will not be revealed and the files/directories can be located outside the webroot. 
Each file can also be assigned a download counter, which is stored in a custom database table.

The FileDownloadR project was started in 2011 by [Rico Goldsky](https://github.com/goldsky) as a rewite of the 
FileDownload Evolution package by Kyle Jaebker. It is maintained since 2023 by [Thomas Jakobi](https://github.com/Jako).

FileDownloadR can be installed from within the MODX Revolution manager via Package Management, or from the MODX Extras 
Repository, available on [modx.com/extras/package/filedownloadr](https://modx.com/extras/package/filedownloadr)

FileDownloadR has a GitHub repository at [github.com/Jako/FileDownloadR](https://github.com/Jako/FileDownloadR). Any 
bug can be issued in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Jako/FileDownloadR/issues)

The package documentation can be found at [jako.github.io/FileDownloadR](http://jako.github.io/FileDownloadR/)
