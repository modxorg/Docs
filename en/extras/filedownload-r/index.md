# FileDownload R

FileDownload R is a snippet that will display a list of files from user's directory.

This snippet is a complete rewrite of the [Kyles Jabber](http://muddydogpaws.com/)'s [FileDownload](http://wiki.modxcms.com/index.php/FileDownload) for MODX Evolution. 
This Revolution version was built by goldsky. 
Download: <http://modx.com/extras/package/filedownloadr>
Any bugs can be issued on here: <https://github.com/goldsky/FileDownload-R/issues>

This snippet does not reveal your real path to the link, but it uses a hashed link instead. 
The best thing is that you can store the files/directories outside of the webroot, and this script will do the rest.

The download counter is stored inside a custom database.

There are 2 snippets of this package:

1. [FileDownload](/extras/revo/filedownload-r/filedownload-r.filedownload "FileDownload R.FileDownload")
2. [FileDownloadLink](/extras/revo/filedownload-r/filedownload-r.filedownloadlink "FileDownload R.FileDownloadLink")

Since v. 1.0.0-pl, this package also provides plugin feature to enable developer adding their additional functions for the downloading process.
