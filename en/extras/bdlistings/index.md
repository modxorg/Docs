bdListings is a listing addon with a flexible architecture to allow different categories, target groups, price groups and images per setup. It allows you to create easy listings with a link to a different site (of the person offering the listing, most likely) for which every click can be tracked.

bdListings has been developed by Mark Hamstra for BD Creative for a birthday activities portal and [v1.0.0-pl was released on November 25th, 2011.](http://modx.com/extras/package/bdlistings)
