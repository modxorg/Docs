## What is Image+?

Image+ is an advanced image custom template variable type for MODX Revolution. The dimensions for the uploaded image can (optionally) be configured to constrain a minimal width and/or height. The image crop could be forced to remain at a pre-set ratio. A graphical tool could be used to crop the image to the required dimensions/proportions.

## Requirements

- MODX Revolution 2.6 or later
- PHP 7.1 or later
- MODX Cropping Engine i.e. [pThumb](https://modx.com/extras/package/pthumb)
