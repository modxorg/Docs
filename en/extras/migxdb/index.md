## What is MIGXdb? 

MIGXdb (multiItems-dbGridTv for modx) is a custom-tv-input-type for managing (resource-related) records of custom-db-tables or (child)-resources or what you want in a TV.

It has a configurable grid and a configurable tabbed editor-window to add and edit items of your tables. They can be related to resources.

You can use TV-input-types for the db-fields in the form-window.

Its also very easy to create CMPs (Custom Manager Pages) to manage your custom-tables with help of MIGXdb.
