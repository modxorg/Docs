It can also currently be integrated into either the [Register](extras/login/login.register "Login.Register") snippet, [Quip](extras/quip "Quip") comments, or into any [FormIt](extras/formit "FormIt")-powered form.

## Requirements

-   MODX Revolution 2.0.7 or later
-   PHP5 or later
-   mcrypt PHP extension
-   [Login](extras/login "Login") Extra, version 1.5.2 or later

## Usage

Rampart currently comes with 3 Snippets:

-   [preHook.RampartRegister](extras/rampart/rampart.prehook.rampartregister "Rampart.preHook.RampartRegister") - Handles spam prevention when using the [Register](extras/login/login.register "Login.Register") snippet.
-   [hook.RampartFormIt](extras/rampart/rampart.hook.rampartformit "Rampart.hook.RampartFormIt") - Hook that can be used to integrate Rampart into any FormIt-based form.
-   [hook.RampartQuip](extras/rampart/rampart.hook.rampartquip "Rampart.hook.RampartQuip") - Hook that can be used to integrate Rampart into Quip comments.

It also comes with a Custom Manager Page, where you can manage your banlist, moderate flagged users, and view attempts your bans caught.

### Enabling Project Honey Pot DNS Blacklisting

Rampart comes with integration for [Project Honey Pot](http://www.projecthoneypot.org), a anti-spam service that prevents spam harvesters and comment spammers access to your site entirely. Through the RampartWall plugin, Rampart will completely prevent access to your site for IPs flagged by Project Honey Pot, and will automatically add them to the Rampart Ban list.

You can enable the HoneyPot integration by setting the appropriate values for the following System Settings:

-   rampart.honeypot.access_key - Set this to your Access Key you received for your HoneyPot account. This is required for the integration to work.
-   rampart.honeypot.enabled - When you've setup your Access Key, set this to 'Yes' to enable the HoneyPot integration. You can set this to 'No' at any time to disable HoneyPot checks.
